                <h2>Dear Jeremiah,</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered why the stars shine so brightly when we're
                    together? I think it's because even the universe celebrates our love.
                    Every time I look at you, I discover something new to fall in love with
                    the way your eyes crinkle when you laugh, the gentle touch of your hand,
                    the kindness you show to everyone around you. I never believed in love
                    at first sight until that moment. Now, each day with you feels like
                    falling in love all over again. You've colored my world in ways I never
                    imagined possible. Before you, life was in black and white; now, every
                    day is painted in the most beautiful shades of love and joy. In my arms,
                    I've found more than love, I've found my home, my safe haven, my love.
                    You understand my silences, celebrate my victories, and comfort me
                    through my struggles. With you, I don't need to pretend to be someone
                    else. You love me completely, wholly, just as I am.
                </p>
